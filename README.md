# simple-priority-queue
This is a simple priority queue implementation for JavaScript. This library is a stand-alone library and doesn't have any third-party dependencies. 

## Initializing
Create an object of type PriorityQueue by passing the type the Queue deal with. If you want the Queue to store Foo, then pass the type Foo.
 
`let priortityQueue: PriorityQueue<Foo> = new PriorityQueue<Foo>();`

## Enqueue an Item
Use the `Enqueue` method in the library and pass the item that you want to store along with the priority.
`priortityQueue.Enqueue(foo, 1);`
